\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Calvin}
The week a new post-filtering amplifier was created to help with the stability in the signal thus allowing for the consistent calculations with the SpO2 values. This is a non-inverting amplifier therefore 2 parts of previous circuit are not needed anymore therefore also helping reducing the size of the circuit making the circuit more efficient and less complex.
\subsection{Kavin}
This week I reformatted my code such that it was easier to understand aswell as implemented the SpO2 calculations in full form, In addition I worked on the multiplexer so that we would be able to intake both red and ired signals from the sensor, for this I also used the wave gen on the AD2 to produce a waveform which would turn the respective LEDS on and off so that we can get the needed data.

\subsection{Calvin}
\subsubsection{Amplifier Recreation}
It was found that the common source amplifier was too unstable with the circuit. Therefore to improve the stability of the signal output a new type of amplifier was needed to be created due to the difficulty of calculating the SpO2 values from an unstable signal. Thus, with inspiration from [4] it was decided that a simple op-amp amplifier was used to be used to amplify the signal after the filtering of the signal. Using the information given in [4] the circuit below was created:

\newpage

The amplifier circuit seen above takes the idea of a non-inverting op-amp amplifier and adds some changes to amplify the AC signal but not the DC signal. The amplification equation is still ruled by the basic equation of A\textsubscript{O} = (1 + R\textsubscript{F}/R\textsubscript{1}) but the equation is now different between AC and DC signals. 
In DC conditions, it can be see the coupling capacitor will be a open circuit thus causing the equation to be:
\begin{align}
A_{O} &= (1 +\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}) \\
A_{O} &= (1 +\frac{100k\Omega}{\infty\Omega}) \\
A_{O} &= (1 + 0) \\
A_{O} &= 1
\end{align}
Therefore the gain for DC conditions in this circuit is unity(aka. 1).
In AC conditions, it can be see the coupling capacitor will be a short circuit thus causing the equation to be:
\begin{align}
A_{O} &= (1 +\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{3}}) \\
A_{O} &= (1 +\frac{100k\Omega}{10k\Omega + 5k\Omega}) \\
A_{O} &= (1 + 6.67) \\
A_{O} &= 7.67
\end{align}
Therefore the gain for AC conditions in this circuit is around 6.67.
From previous iterations of the circuit it is know the output from the filter is an AC wave with an amplitude of around 10mV riding on a DC voltage of around 1.8V.
This is simulated in the circuit above with the result from gain equations solved above being for DC:
\begin{align}
V_{O} &= A_{O} * V{in} \\
V_{O} &= 1 * 1.8V \\
V_{O} &= 1.8V
\end{align}
For AC:
\begin{align}
V_{O} &= A_{O} * V{in} \\
V_{O} &= 7.67 * 10mV \\
V_{O} &= 76.7mV
\end{align}

This leads to final result simulation of:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Op-Amp Out.png}

*The input is seen in green and the output is seen in blue*
\newpage
The final final when build out looks like:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/2804_Amp.jpg}

The circuit needs to be fully tested but first results are promising and when the circuit has been full tested it will be implemented in the place of the common source amplifier also replacing the inverting op-amp and clamper circuit.

\subsubsection*{Code Reformatting/Completion}
What I need to do to modify my code is to make it cleaner aswell as make more variables to store the factors that keep track of the various waves because as it is we are only intaking the red signal while in reality we need to be intaking the ired signal so thats what needs to be done and can be seen done in the code below.

\end{lstlisting}
This code should create the intended outcome, the only thing that needs to be modified the input of the ired and red signals via multiplexer which will allow us to take in multiple signals at a time.

Another slight design choice I made which is notable is that I would only be displaying the red wavelength signal as both waves are almost identical when displayed so seeing one wave or the other is good enough to give the user a good representation of the input wave.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Calvin}
Now that a new amplifier has been created for the circuit, the amplifier needs to be tested and connected to the circuit. Then, the circuit needs to be made cleaner along with other small changes to make things understandable for the final report and presentation. Finally, work will be started on the final report and presentation, the presentation and report will be combining everything together thus the circuit and code needs to be simplified.
\subsection{Kavin}
Now that all subsystems are working any remaining work will include making function of subsystems more consistent and easy to use for the user and making the organization of the diagrams and code for the function of these systems easier to interpret. Also work will begin on the final presentation and report. This report will need good presentation of all designs so making those as clean and easy to understand as possible is a priority since that will make it easier to grade and reproduce if needed.
